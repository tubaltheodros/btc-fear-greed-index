            <h2>Why Measure Fear and Greed?</h2>
            <p>The cryptocurrency market is driven by emotionâ€”greed can push prices to unsustainable highs, while fear can trigger irrational sell-offs. This sentiment index is designed to help you navigate these market swings with a clear, data-driven perspective, reducing the risk of emotional decision-making.
                A common investment strategy is to buy when fear dominates and sell when greed takes over. By tracking sentiment across different sectors of the crypto market, this indicator provides valuable insights into overall market sentiment, helping you make informed decisions instead of reacting impulsively. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Extreme fear</strong>: May signal a buying opportunity.</li>
                <li><strong>Extreme greed</strong>: May indicate the market is overheated.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Sources</h2>
            <p>I gathered this data from four main sources to create a comprehensive Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index. The algorithm analyzes sentiment on Reddit discussions, calculates Bitcoin's 24-hour price volatility patterns, and incorporates data from established sentiment indicators. These diverse inputs are weighted and combined through a custom Python algorithm to produce a single, robust metric that captures market sentiment more accurately than any individual source could provide.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Market Volatility Analysis (40%)</strong>: Quantifies Bitcoin's recent price movements against historical volatility patterns to identify periods of market uncertainty or confidence.</li>
                <li><strong>Alternative.me Sentiment Index (30%)</strong>: Incorporates established sentiment metrics that analyze discussions across multiple social platforms and forums to detect shifting market psychology.</li>
                <li><strong>Reddit Sentiment Analysis (20%)</strong>: Uses natural language processing to evaluate the tone, frequency, and engagement of Bitcoin-related discussions on the platform where cryptocurrency enthusiasts gather.</li>
            </ul>
